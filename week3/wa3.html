            <h1>About</h1>
            <a>I am currently a student majoring in Economics and minoring in Creative Technology and Design at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
                <br>I enjoy traveling all across the United States and going to as many National Parks as I can. In addition to this I love outdoor activites, such as dirtbike riding, snowboarding, hiking, and much more. I am originally from a small coastal town called San Clemente but have been at Boulder for the past 3 years.</a>
